"""Constitution fix v2.7: preserve full Visual, cinematic 3-query ordered sources.

Fixes:
- Preserves full Visual field including comma-separated detail (no split on comma, no [:40] truncation)
- Appends "4k slow motion b-roll cinematic" for pexels_video query (same as JS fix)
- Generates exactly 3 ordered query objects per scene: pexels_video (cinematic full), pixabay_video (shorter core 3-4 words), unsplash_image (shortest)
- Stops leaking script words like "might", "obsolete", "coming", "year", "small", "businesses", "drowning", "imagine", "software", "shift", "machine", "impact", "simulate" as single-word queries
- Video preferred first order
